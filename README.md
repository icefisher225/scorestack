A security competition scoring system built on the Elastic stack.

The Scorestack documentation is [hosted online](https://docs.scorestack.io). The documentation is written in markdown and built with [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook). If the online documentation is unavailable or you simply prefer reading the raw markdown files, take a look in [the docs folder](https://github.com/scorestack/scorestack/tree/main/docs) of the repository.
